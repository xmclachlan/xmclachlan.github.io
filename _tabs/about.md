I'm Xavier McLachlan, a Business and Information Systems student at UTS with a passion for technology, cybersecurity, and digital problem-solving. I support small teams with IT and web projects, compete in cybersecurity challenges, and build personal projects ranging from my homelab to web apps. I'm also a competitive sailor and 2024 Youth Match Racing National Champion, bringing focus and adaptability to everything I do.

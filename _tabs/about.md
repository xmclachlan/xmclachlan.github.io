I'm Xavier McLachlan, a Business and Information Systems student at UTS with a passion for technology, cybersecurity, and digital problem-solving. I support small teams with IT and web projects, compete in cybersecurity challenges, and build personal projects ranging from my homelab to web apps. I'm also a competitive sailor and 2024 Youth Match Racing National Champion, bringing focus and adaptability to everything I do.

I am also working on my Business and Information Systems Degree at [UTS](https://uts.edu.au), where I am majoring in Marketing. I am part of the [CSEC](https://utscyber.org) and [ProgSoc](https://progsoc.org) societies, which I attend when I can. Over my course I have studied, networking, databases, programming, design thinking, project management, statistics, and more. So far I have really enjoyed Networking and Databases.
